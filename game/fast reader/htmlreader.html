    <div class="scroll">Consequently, in addition to the standard DOM properties, methods, and events that we’ve already played with in this book, form-related elements support a bunch of extra properties and methods that are defined in a separate section of the DOM standard.1 The most useful of these properties and methods are listed in Table 6.2 and Table 6.1, respectively. Form controls also support a handful of extra events, which are listed in Table 6.3.</div>​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
